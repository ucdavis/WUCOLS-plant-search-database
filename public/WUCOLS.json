Most plants offered are selections of <u>L. indica</u>, a red-flowered species native to southeastern China, or hybrids of <u>L. indica</u> and <u>L. fauriei</u>, a white-flowered species from Japan. Dozens of cultivars with flowers in many shades of red, pink, purple, and white and some with purple leaves. Best where summers are long and hot, but some cultivars perform acceptably in cooler climates. Sun, good drainage, good air circulation.
